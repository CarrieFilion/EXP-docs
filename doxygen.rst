Doxygen EXP web pages

.. index:: Doxygen

Doxygen generates an HTML reference manual from stylized comments
written into the EXP class definitions.  This allows us to visualize
the relationships between the various classes by providing dependency
graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are
all generated automatically.

Doxygen is optional and is configured when compiling EXP using the
``BUILD_DOCS`` feature (:ref:`installing EXP <compile-features>`).  The
resulting HTML directory is in ``source_dir/doc/html``.
