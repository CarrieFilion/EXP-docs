<para>I wrote the EXP code over about 20 years, incorporating published biorthogonal expansions and my own published and unpublished work on n-body methodology. This version has been rewritten to exploit the similarity in overall structure of all biorthogonal expansions and C++ object-oriented style. </para>
<para>The project has two primary goals: <itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>To develop a state-of-the-art research tool for my own research and the research of my group and outside collaborators </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>To continue to advance the methodology to allow more complex galactic interactions to be studied </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>The current version is ANSI C++ compliant (or nearly so and uses c++-14 features) and includes dynamic loading of user libraries with a standard interface, allowing independent development and testing of force routines, component interactions, etc. without recompiling or affecting the main code (see: <ref refid="modules" kindref="compound">User loadable modules</ref>). The source is maintained with <ulink url="https://git-scm.com/">git</ulink> to facilitate collaborative development and hosted by <ulink url="https://bitbucket.org/mdweinberg/exp">Bitbucket</ulink>.</para>
<para>Recent enhancments include a GPU implementation for adaptive basis force evaluation and ongoing development of Direct Simulation Monte Carlo gas dynamics. </para>
<para>Note: this code is <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> in the public domain. You need permission from the author to use it. </para>

<para>Research making use of and feeding back into this project has been supported in part by the NASA ATP, NSF Astronomy, and the University of Massachusetts/Amherst. I thank the Simons Foundation/CCA for providing access to a state-of-the-art GPU cluster, where the CUDA suport for adaptive force bases is being tested. </para>
