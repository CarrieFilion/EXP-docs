In this tutorial, we'll assume that EXP is already installed on your system.
If that's not the case, see :ref:`intro-install`.

This tutorial will walk you through these tasks:

1. Import the example repository from github
2. Adjust the configuration file for your system
3. Run EXP on the example
4. Try some of the simple pyEXP analysis notebooks

This tutorial covered only the basics of EXP, but there's a lot of other
features not mentioned here. Check the :ref:`topics-whatelse` section in
:ref:`intro-overview` chapter for a quick overview of the most important ones.
